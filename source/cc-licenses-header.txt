# Custom selection of license metadata from Creative Commons

#
# According to the metadata, the licenses themselves are licensed under
# <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>. Since this URI designates the
# *web page*, presumably this metadata is also published under that license.
#
# However, this is contradicted by the statements in their corresponding "legal
# code" documents (e.g. at
# <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode>), which reads:
#
# > The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public
# > domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.
#
# We have contacted Creative Commons to get a clarification of this. According
# to them:
#
# > The legal text of the CC Licenses is dedicated to the public domain with
# > CC0. Therefore the meta-data tags are also available under those terms.
#
# This is very accommodating, and facilitates any use and re-use of this
# metadata. We leave this notice in place to be clear.
